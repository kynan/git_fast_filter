Syntax:
  collab --help

  collab info
    Report the path to the original repo, the excludes and includes they
    had used, whether there were commits on collab/master that weren't
    on master, etc.

  collab pull-grafts
    Take commits from the original repository and add them
    to the collab/<branch> branches of the filtered repository

  collab push-grafts
    Take commits from this repository and place them in
    collab/<branch> branches of the original repository

  collab clone REPOSITORY [OPTIONS] [--] [REVISION LIMITING]
    Create a [filtered] clone of a repository.
Notes:
  REPOSITORY is a path to a repository, OPTIONS is some mix of
    --exclude=PATH
    --exclude-file=FILE-WITH-PATHS
    --include=PATH
    --include-file=FILE-WITH-PATHS
  and REVISION LIMITING is options acceptable to git log to reduce the total
  list of revisions, examples of which include
    --since='2 years ago'
    master~10000..master
    master 4.10 4.8 ^4.6

  If OPTIONS is not specified, everything is included.  If REVISION LIMITING
  is not specified, "--branches --tags" is the default.

  Once the clone has completed, you'll need to run 'git merge collab/<branch>'
  in order to populate your working tree.

    """
    This class implements the functionality that the tool provides.

    Some key implementation details:
    All of the data that needs to persist from one execution of the tool
    to another is recorded as a ref in git under refs/collab/DATA with
    DATA being one of:

    excludes  : The original excludes given to collab in the cloning
    includes  : The original includes given to collab in the cloning
    orig_repo : The handle to the repository collab cloned from
    filteredmap   : The commit-map for commits in the filtered repository
    unfilteredmap : The commit-map for commits from the original repository

    Important concept: commit-map. These maps map a mark* to a commit id
    (hash). The raw commit-ids will not necessarily be meaningful to
    both source and target repositories due to the presence of includes,
    excludes, and history chopping (since any of these will change the
    contents of certain commits). These keys allow us to refer to
    correlated commits in both repositories.

    *The notion of a mark is an important concept. Fast-export uses a simple
    int that is incremented once per exported object to identify the object
    without having to use it's sha1 hash. This is an ideal way for us to
    refer to commits in a portable way (has proper meaning in both source
    and target repo).
